# MyMLPlayground

Welcome to MyMLPlayground! This repository serves as a playground for experimenting with machine learning algorithms, models, datasets, and more.
The main resource for my ML lerning journey has been [Hands-on Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras and TensorFlow (3rd edition)](https://homl.info/er3)

## Overview

In this repository, you'll find:

- **Notebooks**: Jupyter notebooks containing various machine learning experiments and projects.
- **Datasets**: Sample datasets used for training and testing machine learning models.
- **Scripts**: Python scripts for various machine learning tasks, such as data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- **Documentation**: Documentation and tutorials explaining the concepts and techniques used in the machine learning projects.

## Getting Started

### Want to play with these notebooks online without having to install anything?

* <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/ageron/handson-ml3/blob/main/" target="_parent"><img src="https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg" alt="Open In Colab"/></a> (recommended)

âš  _Colab provides a temporary environment: anything you do will be deleted after a while, so make sure you download any data you care about._

Other services may work as well, but I have not fully tested them:

### Want to run this project using a Docker image?
Read the [Docker instructions](https://github.com/ageron/handson-ml3/tree/main/docker).

### Want to install this project on your own machine?

Start by installing [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution) (or [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)), [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads), and if you have a TensorFlow-compatible GPU, install the [GPU driver](https://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx), as well as the appropriate version of CUDA and cuDNN (see TensorFlow's documentation for more details).

Next, clone this project by opening a terminal and typing the following commands (do not type the first `$` signs on each line, they just indicate that these are terminal commands):

    $ git clone https://github.com/ageron/handson-ml3.git
    $ cd handson-ml3

Next, run the following commands:

    $ conda env create -f environment.yml
    $ conda activate homl3
    $ python -m ipykernel install --user --name=python3

Finally, start Jupyter:

    $ jupyter notebook

If you need further instructions, read the [detailed installation instructions](INSTALL.md).
